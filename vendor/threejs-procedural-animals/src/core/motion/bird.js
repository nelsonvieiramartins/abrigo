// Bird motion engine: bipedal walking and hopping, flapping and gliding flight in 3D, take-off,
// landing (on the ground or gripping a perch), and every standard action, for the standard bird
// skeleton of core/rig/bird.js (crow, chicken, eagle, ...).
//
// Ground: a two-leg gait engine (phase-offset table blended by speed: alternating walks and runs,
// two-footed hops with a real flight phase) plants the feet with terrain-aware swing paths; the leg
// IK keeps the femur near its rest angle inside the body and solves tibiotarsus + tarsometatarsus to
// the planted foot (the ankle points back), rolling the foot onto the toes at push-off; toes curl
// in swing and spread before touchdown. The body bobs from the gait phase (walk: highest at mid
// stance; hop: a ballistic arc between two compressions), the head holds still in space and thrusts
// forward once per step (head bob), the tail bobs and sways.
// Air: airspeed, heading (banked, coordinated turns) and climb rate follow the input with the
// species' limits; a power demand (slow flight, climb, acceleration) drives stroke amplitude and
// frequency between cruise and take-off beats, and fades them to a glide when descending; the body
// pitches with the flight path and bobs with each downstroke; wings follow a stroke cycle (elevation,
// sweep, pronation, flexed upstroke) whose feather fan follows the wrist extension; the tail fans and
// steers; the terrain is never closer than the clearance unless landing. A species may opt into a sleek
// cruise-flight carriage (flight.shape, below: off by default): the head carried forward and low on an
// extended neck, the neck, torso and thigh plumage sleeked, the tail fanned; eased in once airborne and
// out for the flare, after touchdown and in a fall.
// Transitions: take-off (crouch, leg jump, first downstroke at toe-off, steep climb with fast deep
// beats, legs tucked back), landing (a guided path to the touch point, flare: body pitched up, wings
// raised and swept forward for braking beats, tail fanned and depressed, legs thrown forward; the
// feet plant where they touch, the body absorbs, wings stay up briefly then fold), perching (land on
// a target point and grip it: toes wrap the branch).
// Neck: the bind neck is fitted with a cubic Bezier (end tangents from the joints); every pose bends
// that curve from the chest to the head (arc length solved from the chord: a short chord folds the S
// and telescopes the neck a little), so the rest pose reproduces the bind neck exactly; part of the
// gaze turns the whole neck. The head is gaze stabilised, moves in quick saccades toward what it
// looks at and cocks to look with one eye.
// Perches: play('perch', { target, axis?, radius? }) or createAnimal({ perches: [points] }) - the bird
// flies there (flying out and back round when the target is inside its turning circle), settles
// facing across the branch and grips it. LOD 2 (crowd): feathers and toes ride rigidly on their
// carrier bones between full solves (every 3rd frame), cheaper neck solve.
//
// Lessons kept from the cheetah: continuous solves (every target is a continuous function of state;
// nothing jumps between frames), soft IK limits, motion from phase (not from events), springs for
// secondary motion, zero-dt safety, no allocations in the per-frame paths.
