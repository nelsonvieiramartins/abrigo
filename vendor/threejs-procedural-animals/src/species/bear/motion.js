// Brown bear motion data for the quadruped engine (schema: src/core/motion/quadruped.js).

// moderate speed they walk (lateral sequence, limb phase 0.2-0.25, mean 1.7 m/s), use a running
// walk / amble (singlefoot, at most two feet down, no suspension, ~2.6 m/s) and a three-beat canter
// (~2.9 m/s, no suspension); above ~4 m/s a rotary gallop with one gathered suspension, the hind
// feet landing close together, big spinal flexion (charges at 11-13 m/s). Stride frequencies
// from speed and Heglund-Taylor scaling, x1.14 for the reference individual's hip height (0.77 m
// against the ~1.0 m of the adults in research 4.1: f ~ 1 / sqrt(leg length)). The walk swaggers: the shoulders and hump roll +-4-6 deg,
// the head swings with the forelegs (behaviour.js), the forefeet swing out and land toes-in.
