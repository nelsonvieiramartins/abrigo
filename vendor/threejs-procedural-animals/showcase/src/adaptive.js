// Adaptive quality with hysteresis (the showcase's pixel ratio, grass density and the hero's coat tier).
//
// The frame time is averaged over windows of `window` seconds. A window over `slowMs` steps one tier
// down at once; `upAfter` seconds of windows under `fastMs` step one tier up. An upgrade that is undone
// within `failWithin` seconds (the better tier is too slow for this view) is not tried again for
// `backoff` seconds, doubling with every further failure up to `backoffMax`, unless the hero becomes
// much smaller on screen than when it failed (the cost of a coat follows its size on screen: zooming out
// earns another try). Without this memory a view that was fast at one tier and slow at the next went up
// and down for ever, every ~13 s on a 120 Hz display, and the hero's fur appeared and disappeared with it.
//
// Pure logic (no DOM, no three.js).
